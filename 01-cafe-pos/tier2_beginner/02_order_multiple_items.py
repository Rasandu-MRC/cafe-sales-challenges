CHALLENGE: Take a Full Order
DIFFICULTY: Beginner
FOLDER: 01-cafe-pos / tier2_beginner

STORY
-----
A customer wants to order several things, one at a time, until they say
they're finished. You need to keep a running total of what they owe.

YOUR TASK
---------
1. Keep asking the customer "What would you like? (type 'done' to finish)"
2. Every time they type a valid menu item, add its price to a running total
   and print a short confirmation.
3. If they type something not on the menu (and not "done"), print a message
   saying it's not available, and ask again.
4. When they type "done", stop asking and print their final total.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT
--------------
What would you like? (type 'done' to finish): Coffee
Added Coffee - $4.5
What would you like? (type 'done' to finish): Muffin
Added Muffin - $5.0
What would you like? (type 'done' to finish): Pizza
Sorry, Pizza is not on the menu.
What would you like? (type 'done' to finish): done
Your total is $9.5

HINTS
-----
- Use a `while True:` loop, and use `break` to stop it when the customer
  types "done".
- Keep a variable like `total = 0` outside the loop, and add to it inside.
